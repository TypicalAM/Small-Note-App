# Static Site Generator

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This is a static site generator made in [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). It checks for markdown files in the markdown directory, renders them to HTML and serves them locally. For example the file `markdown/test/example.md` can be viewed in the browser at `example.com/test/example.md`. This app was created for me to try to tidy my university notes (and start finally learning golang and gin).
